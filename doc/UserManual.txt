Welcome to your Mandelbrot/Julia Visualizer brought to you by DuckieCorp(TM) Copyright 2018, Nathan Thomson


In order to run your program:	
	1: Open command prompt and go to the location where your file is contained	
	2: Type "python src/main.py " followed by the location of the fractile file you would like to visualize
		EXAMPLE: (python src/main.py data/fullmandelbrot.frac)
	3: Input the RGB values of the two colors, as prompted by the program
	4: Input the file type you would like the photo to be saved as
	5: Wait for your photo to be created
	6: Enjoy!

To ensure your program runs smootly, make sure that your fractile file follows this format:

Mandelbrot Example:
	type: Mandelbrot
	pixels: 640
	centerX: 0.0
	centerY: 0.0
	axisLength: 4.0
	iterations: 100

Julia Example:
	type: Julia
	cReal: -1
	cImag: 0
	pixels: 1024
	centerX: 0.618
	centerY: 0.0
	axisLength: 0.017148277367054
	iterations: 78
